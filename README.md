# DSA Playground Read Me 

This is a repo for playing with Data Structures and Algorithms in either javascript or php as a Test Driven Development Learning Experiment. Using _Codeless Data Structures and Algorithms: Learn DSA Without Writing a Single Line of Code_ to remember and use the information to build my own tested algorithms and datastructures.
